## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
```

I want to insert some code into my writing `hereis <- my code`

```{r,fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
plot(1:10)
```


```{r Datatable}
data(mpg)
DT::datatable(mpg, caption="Mileage")
```


##Data Organization

Get some data from a url.

```{r Download_Some_Data}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(catch_df)
```


Use this to identify unique values in a column.

```{r}
unique(catch_df$notesRegCode)
```

This will select certain columns using the pipe operatore. Use ctrl+shft+M to hotkey a pipe "%>%".

```{r Select_Columns}
catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% 
  head()
```

You can also accomplish the same thing by using negative arguments.

```{r Negative_Select_Columns}
catch_df %>% 
  select(-All, -notesRegCode) %>% 
  head()
```
